abstract = {The progress of data mining technology and large public popularity establish a need for a comprehensive text on the subject. The series of books entitled by 'Data Mining' address the need by presenting in-depth description of novel mining algorithms and many useful applications. In addition to understanding each section deeply, the two books present useful hints and strategies to solving problems in the following chapters. The contributing authors have highlighted many future research directions that will foster multi-disciplinary collaborations and hence will lead to significant development in the field of data mining.},
